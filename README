vsDB version $Revision: 1.4.3 $
==========================================

vsDB provides Perl programmers with a simple object-oriented 
interface for text-delimited data files.  The object model is very similar 
to Microsoft's ADO RecordSet object, so if you've used that, vsDB will be a bit 
familiar to you. The primary difference is that you don't use SQL commands to 
retrieve data.  Instead, all data is loaded from flat files. You use the 
Filter method to find individual or groups of records and the Sort method to 
order your results.

Please see the POD for the module for additional information.
